I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/). I am advised by [Prof. Yongjoo Park](https://yongjoopark.com/). I have experience solving problems in various areas related to big data, machine learning, and systems. 

Previously, I was a Research Associate II at the *Data-driven Systems, Insights, and Experiences Group* at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/research/) for 2 years, where I worked on designing and implementing solutions to reduce storage/compute costs, improve data management & governance, and optimize the performance of data-driven systems in Adobe's Experience Platform. This involved working with data at large scales (TBs-PBs) and applying machine learning and data analytics on enterprise customer data and system level metrics. My primary advisors at Adobe were [Dr. Koyel Mukherjee](https://in.linkedin.com/in/koyel-mukherjee-7b47024) and [Dr. Shiv Kumar Saini](https://in.linkedin.com/in/shiv-saini-696ab86).

I received my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](iitk.ac.in) in 2021. Earlier in 2019, I visited the [University of California, San Diego (UCSD)](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/), where I worked on unsupervised vision-based depth estimation in driving scenes. I was advised by [Prof. Dinesh Bharadia](https://dineshb-ucsd.github.io/) and [Dr. Gaurav Bansal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurav-bansal-0558596). 

At college, I also co-founded and led the [IIT Kanpur Consulting Group](https://iitkconsult.org), where we helped social organizations and government entities leverage better insights from their data by applying machine learning techniques.
