I am a Research Associate at the *Data-driven Systems, Insights, and Experiences Group* at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/research/). My current research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, big data management, and systems. I am working on several projects motivated towards improving the performance of data-driven systems in terms of time, cost, and the quality of services provided to users. My primary advisors are [Dr. Koyel Mukherjee](https://in.linkedin.com/in/koyel-mukherjee-7b47024) and [Dr. Shiv Kumar Saini](https://in.linkedin.com/in/shiv-saini-696ab86).

I received my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](iitk.ac.in) in 2021. Earlier in 2019, I visited the [University of California, San Diego (UCSD)](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/), where I worked on unsupervised vision-based depth estimation in driving scenes. I was advised by [Prof. Dinesh Bharadia](https://dineshb-ucsd.github.io/) and [Dr. Gaurav Bansal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurav-bansal-0558596). 

At college, I also started and led the [IIT Kanpur Consulting Group](https://iitkconsult.org), where we worked on some interesting projects around using machine learning to create a social impact.
