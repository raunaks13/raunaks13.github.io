This leads to both increased storage costs and unnecessarily high compute costs for the maintenance of these datasets. In this work we focus on identifying and reducing redundancy in enterprise data lakes by addressing the problem of "dataset containment". To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works that addresses table level containment at a large scale. To achieve this, we propose building a dataset containment graph in a scalable manner. Our three-step hierarchical pipeline, R2D2, efficiently identifies all instances of containment by progressively reducing the search space in the data lake via: (i) schema graph builder, (ii) statistical min-max pruning, and (iii) content level pruning. Next, we propose to reduce the storage and maintenance costs due to this redundancy in an optimal manner by deleting datasets, while keeping the customer experience unaffected. We provide an optimization formulation that takes a containment graph as input and identifies redundant datasets that can be deleted (and reconstructed on demand, if necessary), while minimizing the overall storage and access costs and respecting any latency constraints. In contrast to existing modified baselines that are inaccurate or take several days to run, our pipeline can process an enterprise customer data lake at the TB scale in approximately 5 hours, while computing a dataset containment graph that captures all existing containment relationships correctly with very few additional edges compared to the ground truth. We implement our system on Azure Databricks clusters using Apache Spark for enterprise data stored in ADLS Gen2, and on AWS clusters for open-source data. We present theoretical results as well as extensive empirical validation on both enterprise (scale of TB) and open-source datasets (scale of MBs - GBs), which showcases the effectiveness of our pipeline. We discuss important aspects for practical implementation such as dynamic updates of data, scalability and latency concerns, as well as data dependent access patterns. Additionally, we show how each component of our system substantially improves over existing baselines in terms of speed and accuracy of containment detection, as well as how we ensure cost reduction via data deletion.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ICDE’23</abbr></div> <div id="mukherjee2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Towards Optimizing Storage Costs on the Cloud</div> <div class="author"> Koyel Mukherjee*, <em>Raunak Shah*</em>, Shiv Saini, Karanpreet Singh,  Khushi, Harsh Kesarwani, Kavya Barnwal, and Ayush Chauhan</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)</em> 2023 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10184773" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We study the problem of optimizing data storage and access costs on the cloud while ensuring that the desired performance or latency is unaffected. We first propose an optimizer that optimizes the data placement tier (on the cloud) and the choice of compression schemes to apply, for given data partitions with temporal access predictions. Secondly, we propose a model to learn the compression performance of multiple algorithms across data partitions in different formats to generate compression performance predictions on the fly, as inputs to the optimizer. Thirdly, we propose to approach the data partitioning problem fundamentally differently than the current default in most data lakes where partitioning is in the form of ingestion batches. We propose access pattern aware data partitioning and formulate an optimization problem that optimizes the size and reading costs of partitions subject to access patterns. We study the various optimization problems theoretically as well as empirically, and provide theoretical bounds as well as hardness results. We propose a unified pipeline of cost minimization, called SCOPe that combines the different modules. We extensively compare the performance of our methods with related baselines from the literature on TPC-H data as well as enterprise datasets (ranging from GB to PB in volume) and show that SCOPe substantially improves over the baselines. We show significant cost savings compared to platform baselines, of the order of 50% to 83% on enterprise Data Lake datasets, ranging from terabytes to petabytes in volume.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ECCV’20</abbr></div> <div id="cheng2020s" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">S3Net: Semantic-Aware Self-supervised Depth Estimation with Monocular Videos and Synthetic Data</div> <div class="author"> Bin Cheng, Inderjot Singh Saggu, <em>Raunak Shah</em>, Gaurav Bansal, and Dinesh Bharadia</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV)</em> 2020 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123750052.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF</a> <a href="https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123750052-supp.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supp</a> <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zIWXpU4LTrZjynLFQO5xFJKYX32RNnt8fA8-vXWdR3I/edit?usp=sharing" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slides</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Solving depth estimation with monocular cameras enables the possibility of widespread use of cameras as low-cost depth estimation sensors in applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, learning such a scalable depth estimation model would require a lot of labeled data which is expensive to collect. There are two popular existing approaches which do not require annotated depth maps: (i) using labeled synthetic and unlabeled real data in an adversarial framework to predict more accurate depth, and (ii) unsupervised models which exploit geometric structure across space and time in monocular video frames. Ideally, we would like to leverage features provided by both approaches as they complement each other; however, existing methods do not adequately exploit these additive benefits. We present S3Net, a self-supervised framework which combines these complementary features: we use synthetic and real-world images for training while exploiting geometric, temporal, as well as semantic constraints. Our novel consolidated architecture provides a new state-of-the-art in self-supervised depth estimation using monocular videos. We present a unique way to train this self-supervised framework, and achieve (i) more than 15% improvement over previous synthetic supervised approaches that use domain adaptation and (ii) more than 10% improvement over previous self-supervised approaches which exploit geometric constraints from the real data.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">ICML Workshop</abbr></div> <div id="goswamy2020ai" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">AI-based Monitoring and Response System for Hospital Preparedness towards COVID-19 in Southeast Asia</div> <div class="author"> Tushar Goswamy, Naishadh Parmar, Ayush Gupta, <em>Raunak Shah</em>, Vatsalya Tandon, Varun Goyal, Sanyog Gupta, Karishma Laud, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

Due to the lack of publicly available data on the influx of patients in hospitals, or the shortage of equipment, ICU units or hospital beds that regions in these countries might be facing, we leverage Twitter data for gleaning this information.

This paper presents DELFI, a novel deep learning-based mixture model to make effective long-term predictions of Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 concentrations. A key novelty in DELFI is its multi-scale approach to the forecasting problem. The observation that point predictions are more suitable in the short-term and probabilistic predictions in the long-term allows accurate predictions to be made as much as 24 hours in advance. DELFI incorporates meteorological data as well as pollutant-based features to ensure a robust model that is divided into two parts: (i) a stack of three Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that perform differential modelling of the same window of past data, and (ii) a fully-connected layer enabling attention to each of the components. Experimental evaluation based on deployment of 13 stations in the Delhi National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR) in India establishes that DELFI offers far superior predictions especially in the long-term as compared to even non-parametric baselines. The Delhi-NCR recorded the 3rd highest PM levels amongst 39 mega-cities across the world during 2011-2015 and DELFI’s performance establishes it as a potential tool for effective long-term forecasting of PM levels to enable public health management and environment protection.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="publications"> <h2 id="patentid">Patents</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="raunaks" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Optimizing Storage-Related Costs with Compression in a Multi-Tiered Storage Device</div> <div class="author"> <em>Raunak Shah</em>, Koyel Mukherjee, Shiv Kumar Saini, Karanpreet Singh,  Khushi, Kavya Barnwal, Harsh Kesarwani, and Ayush Chauhan</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>US Patent App. 17/851,443.
